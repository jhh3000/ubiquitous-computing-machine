This automated decision system recommends stocks to invest in on a given date based on a number of signals:
1) The stock has to appear on that date on the 'Investing Ideas - Long Ideas' list on seekingalpha.com
2) The stock has to be backtested for a year, based on a number of methods (enumerated below)
3) The backtest must be compared to the backtest of all 3 major US indexes
4) The stock backtest must outperform all three backtests for the indexes

The backtest methods are as follows:
1) 50 day moving average (same as hw2)
2) Buy and hold

To calculate the efficacy of this decision system, 10 dates from the window between 1 and 2 years ago are selected at random to be the "trial recommendation," and then those recommendations are put to another backtest for the year after (that we would have held them) The results are below:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++METHOD 1++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


In conclusion, none of these methods yields a great decision system.

This automated decision system recommends stocks to invest in on a given date based on only one signal:
1) The stock has to appear on that date on the 'Investing Ideas - Long Ideas' list on seekingalpha.com

The investing methods once the buy signal is generated are as follows:
1) 50 day moving average (same as hw2)
2) Buy and hold for the entire year
3) Trailing stop (15%)
4) TODO: Trailing stop (15%) with re-entry if the price drops below initial price

To calculate the efficacy of this decision system, 10 dates from the window between 1 and 2 years ago are selected at random to be the "trial recommendation," and then those recommendations are compared against the . The results are below, and the raw output is copied to the text files:

Method 1 (method1.txt): 
Method 2 (method2.txt): 
Method 3 (method3.txt): 

In conclusion, none of these methods yields a great decision system.
